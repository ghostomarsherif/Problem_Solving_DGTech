## Introduction

This roadmap provides a structured approach to mastering C++ problem solving by aligning the theoretical concepts from *C++ How to Program (10th Edition)* by Deitel with practical coding challenges from LeetCode and HackerRank. The progression follows the textbook's chapter sequence while gradually increasing problem difficulty to build a solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming.

**Key Features:**
\begin{itemize}
\item Progressive difficulty aligned with textbook chapters
\item Mix of HackerRank (for concept practice) and LeetCode (for interview preparation)
\item Estimated time commitment per phase
\item Focus on understanding patterns and problem-solving techniques
\item Integration with C++11/C++14 standards as covered in the textbook
\end{itemize}

**Learning Strategy:**
\begin{enumerate}
\item Study the corresponding textbook chapter thoroughly
\item Complete HackerRank problems to practice basic concepts
\item Solve LeetCode problems to apply concepts in interview scenarios
\item Track your progress using a spreadsheet or notebook
\item Revisit challenging problems after 3-7 days for retention
\end{enumerate}
